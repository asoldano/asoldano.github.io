Last week marked _one of the largest releases in JBoss history_: **JBoss AS 7.1.0.Final &#34;Thunder&#34;** is finally out. You can read about the shiny features and achievements that come with the release in any of the multiple posts that have been published these days [[1]](http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jboss-as7-dev/2012-February/005331.html)[[2]](http://dandreadis.blogspot.com/2012/02/introducing-jboss-as-71-final.html)[[3]](https://community.jboss.org/blogs/weekly-editorial/2012/02/17/this-week-in-jboss-16-february-2012-jboss-as-71-and-mode)[[4]](http://jaitechwriteups.blogspot.com/2012/02/jboss-as-710final-thunder-released-java.html), AS 7.1.0.Final really deserves being tried, you&#39;ll love it ;-)
  

Here I&#39;d just like to stress the relevance of having achieved **JavaEE 6 Full Profile compliance**. JBoss AS 7.1.0 satisfies all JavaEE compatibility requirements, allowing for real portability of nowadays enterprise Java applications. Regardless of that, AS 7.1.0.Final is still faster, smaller and more manageable than any previous JBoss AS release.

  


From a webservice point of view, officially achieving JavaEE Full Profile compatibility is the result of more then an year of hard working with TCKs (even before AS 7 actual development start!), given the ws related test groups are among the biggest ones in there.

Finally, I believe this is a great result / milestone also for the [Apache CXF project](http://cxf.apache.org), as JBossWS 4.0.1 installed on JBoss AS 7.1.0 relies on Apache CXF 2.4.6 for serving any JAX-WS functionality.

  


Time to try JBoss AS 7.1 ! [http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads](http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads)
