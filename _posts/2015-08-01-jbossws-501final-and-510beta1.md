It&#39;s summer time, time for a break and for taking some rest... not really, as we released two new versions of **JBossWS** this week :-)  

**JBossWS 5.0.1.Final** is a bug fix [release](http://jbossws.jboss.org/downloads/latest), solving some [issues](http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-cxf-5.0.1.Final.txt) that were found in the first version of the JBossWS 5 series. It also includes Apache CXF ([3.0.6](http://cxf.apache.org/cxf-306-release-notes.html)) and WSS4J upgrades that come with additional multiple fixes and security improvements. The target containers for JBossWS 5.0.1.Final are WildFly 9.0.0.Final as well as the recently released WildFly 8.2.1.Final and 9.0.1.Final.  

**JBossWS 5.1.0.Beta1** is the first [milestone](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jboss/ws/cxf/jbossws-cxf/5.1.0.Beta1/) of the new webservices stack for WildFly 10, instead. While it drops support for Spring integration (_jbossws-cxf.xml_Â descriptor, which was not used a lot and causing confusion and problems), it eventually pulls the latest Apache CXF [3.1.x series](http://cxf.apache.org/docs/31-migration-guide.html). Of course, all the fixes in 5.0.1.Final are included in [5.1.0.Beta1](https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310050&amp;version=12326872) as well.  

Additional new features are coming to 5.1.0 in the next months before it goes Final :-)  

_Summer time... time to get the latest JBossWS releases and give them a try ;-)_  

Enjoy!
