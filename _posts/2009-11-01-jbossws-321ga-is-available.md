After a couple of days spent on the [new website](http://www.jboss.org/jbossws), JBossWS 3.2.1.GA release has just been announced. It features performance improvements, component upgrades, the JAXBIntro support with CXF, bug fixes, etc.  

[Download it](http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/downloads.html) now and give it a try :-)
