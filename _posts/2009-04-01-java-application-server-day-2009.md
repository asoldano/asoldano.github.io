JBoss / Red Hat is joining the [Java Application Server Day 2009](http://www.serverday.org/index.php) in Genoa (Italy) on May, 21st. That&#39;s an interesting event organized by the Genoa JUG; the topic is the state of the art and the future of Java application servers.  

I&#39;ll be there on behalf of JBoss, presenting recent changes in JBoss AS 5. Stay tuned for further updates.
