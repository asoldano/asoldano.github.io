I&#39;m happy to announce that **JBossWS 4.2.0.Final** is out!  

The release comes with lots of new features and bug fixes. To get an idea of the most relevant new functionalities you can have a look at previous posts [here](http://jbossws.blogspot.it/2013/04/jbossws-42-feature-preview.html), [here](http://jbossws.blogspot.it/2013/05/jbossws-420beta1-and-ws-discovery.html) and [here](http://jbossws.blogspot.it/2013/06/jbossws-420cr1-and-ws-policy-sets.html).  

Besides for the mentioned new features, the new version of JBossWS brings the latest and greatest _Apache CXF / WSS4J and Santuario_ versions into **WildFly**, whose next release will include the whole new set of ws libraries.  



It&#39;s now time for you to [download](http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/downloads/latest) JBossWS 4.2.0.Final, install and give it a try! Feedback is welcome as usual!  





The documentation is included in the release distribution (together with the sample testsuite) and is also available at [https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/JBWS](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/JBWS) in its latest version (might include not-released-yet features in future).



The supported target containers for this release are JBoss AS 7.1.2.Final, JBoss AS 7.1.3.Final and JBoss AS 7.2.0.Final. The current WildFly master is also being updated to the new WS components so that future WildFly releases will come with it.



Have fun :-)
