It&#39;s been a week of JBoss / Red Hat web services presentations in the North Italy area.  

As mentioned in the [previous blog entry](http://jbossws.blogspot.com/2011/09/jboss-at-ecows-2011.html), Red Hat has been sponsoring ECOWS 2011, this year&#39;s edition of the European Conference on Web Services. I&#39;ve taken [a session in the industry track](http://ecows2011.inf.usi.ch/program/industry/jboss); the audience seems to have appreciated the Red Hat involvement in the web services area, especially the contribution with the standardization bodies. The slides for my presentation are [available online](http://www.slideshare.net/ecows2011/jboss-red-hat-bridging-the-gap-between-web-services-technologies-and-real-world-needs).  

Today I&#39;ve joined the first meeting of the [Milan JBoss User Group](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/jbug-milano/) and presented on the [webservices subsystem of JBoss Application Server 7](http://www.slideshare.net/alepalin/jboss-as7-web-services). Take a look at slides and get involved with the JBUG, interesting meetings are being planned for the future.
