**JBossWS 4.0.0.CR1** has been released at the end of last week and is currently [available for download](http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/downloads) in binary and source distributions. The release covers both _Native_ and _[Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org/)_ integration stacks and comes with a _huge number of improvements, new features and fixes_ compared to the previous 3.4.1 final release. Have a look at the [news page](http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/news) and the release notes [[1]](http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-cxf-4.0.0.CR1.txt)[[2]](http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-native-4.0.0.CR1.txt) for further details.
  

The release is mainly meant for **[JBoss Application Server 7](http://www.jboss.org/jbossas)** and has been tested against AS 7.0.0, 7.0.1, 7.0.2 and the current 7.1.0 snapshot. JBoss AS 6 support is still included, but might be removed by the time JBossWS 4.0.0 goes final (hopefully soon).

  


**_This is really the right time for giving JBossWS 4 a try before it goes final!_** Any feedback is welcome and might turn into last minute fixes for major issues, if any ;-)

  


Meanwhile we&#39;re working on passing webservices-related tests of the full _JavaEE certification_ testsuite using JBoss AS 7; JBossWS 4.0.0 final is going to be shipped in the final AS 7.1.0 release.
