[Java User Group Lugano](http://www.juglugano.ch/) is organizing its 20th meeting at USI on November, 30th 2011. The event will be completely dedicated to JBoss Application Server 7.  
I&#39;ve been proposed to present there and I&#39;m going to have two sessions, introducing JBoss AS 7 and providing some insights on its webservices subsystem.
