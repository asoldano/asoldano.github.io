While working on the [JBossWS 5 major changes](http://jbossws.blogspot.it/2014/09/wildfly-9-and-jbossws-5-future-is-coming.html), the WS team has been fixing a bunch of [bugs](http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-cxf-4.3.1.Final.txt) that were reported on the 4.3.0.Final release.  

As it&#39;s now more then 5 months since last Final release, we&#39;ve pushed a couple of [Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org/) upgrades (2.7.11 and 2.7.12) into the 4.3.x maintenance branch and released a new micro version, JBossWS 4.3.1.Final.  

The binary and source distributions are available for [download](http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/downloads/latest) and the latest Maven artifacts have been added to the [repository](https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/org/jboss/ws/).  

The supported target containers for this release are JBoss AS 7.2.0.Final, WildFly 8.0.0.Final and WildFly 8.1.0.Final.  

Any feedback, just let us know :-)
