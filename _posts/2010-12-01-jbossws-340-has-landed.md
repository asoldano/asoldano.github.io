It&#39;s been almost two months after 3.4.0.CR1 has been released... but finally [
JBossWS 3.4.0 is out!
](http://jboss.org/jbossws) I&#39;m happy to announce that both [
JBossWS-CXF
](http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-cxf-3.4.0.GA.txt) and [
JBossWS-Native
](http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-native-3.4.0.GA.txt) final versions have been released and are [available for download](http://jboss.org/jbossws/downloads). The supported target containers are 
JBoss AS 5.0.1, 5.1.0 and 6.0.0.CR1
.  

This release is the result of the hard work since the beginning of 2010 on supporting the 
JAXWS 2.2
 and 
JSR 109 v.1.3
 changes required for 
JavaEE 6
. Part of the work actually came through collaboration with the 
[Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org/) community
; as a matter of fact the Apache CXF 2.3 series (included in JBossWS-CXF 3.4.0) features 
JAXWS 2.2 compliant functionalities
.  

JBossWS-CXF 3.4.0 is meant for being the stack providing webservices functionalities to JBoss AS 6, which in turns aims at JavaEE 6 compliance. We&#39;re going to cut another minor release for dealing with last minute integration issues just before AS goes final, but from a feature point of view 3.4.0 already has all you need for JavaEE 6 webservices development.  

Besides that, JBossWS-CXF 3.4.0 comes with all the new features and many bug fixes of Apache CXF 2.3.0 and 2.3.1, part of which were directly contributed by our team members.  
Take a look at the [release notes](http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-cxf-3.4.0.GA.txt) for the full list of improvements.  
Of course, the Maven artifacts for all the released components are also available on the [JBoss public repository](https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/org/jboss/ws/); please give 3.4.0 a try!
