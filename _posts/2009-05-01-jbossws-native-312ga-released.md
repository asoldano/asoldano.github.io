I&#39;ve just released JBossWS-Native 3.1.2GA. This is a minor bug fix release for the Native stack only, required to fix a bunch of issues for the upcoming JBoss AS 5.1.0.GA. The most relevant one to end-users is probably the @EJB annotation support in WS components too.  

Changes related to the Apache CXF and Sun Metro stacks will go the next 3.2.0 version.
