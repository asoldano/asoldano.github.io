[Wise](http://www.jboss.org/wise) is an interesting project with the aim of simplifying webservices invocation. One of the possible [usecases](https://community.jboss.org/wiki/Wise-coreProgrammerGuideversion20) it enables is _quick testing of WS endpoints without the need of generating and compiling client stubs or directly writing SOAP / XML messages_.  

I&#39;ve spent some time lately on this topic and finally cut a [new release](http://www.jboss.org/wise/downloads) of Wise including a [web gui](https://community.jboss.org/wiki/WiseGUIversion10). This runs of top of JBoss AS 7 and is hence based on JBossWS. [Consider having a look](http://jbosswise.blogspot.it/2013/02/wise-is-back.html), to me it&#39;s a convenient tool when it&#39;s time to test WS services (especially for business quality acceptance) and you don&#39;t want to get your hands dirty with code or xml (or you&#39;re not expected to do that, perhaps because you&#39;re a business quality engineer ;-) )
