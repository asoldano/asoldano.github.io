It&#39;s Xmas time and here we are with many great releases!
  

Few hours ago, **JBoss Application Server 7.1.0 CR1** [has been released](http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads): it comes with over 370 jira resolved, numerous management and clustering improvements and the _EE6 Full Profile support is feature complete_.

  


Speaking of web services, one of the AS 7.1.0.CR1 updated components is **JBossWS 4.0.0.GA**, which has been released yesterday and is [available for download](http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/downloads) starting from today.

The first final version of the JBossWS 4 series solves few minor issues over the [previously announced](http://jbossws.blogspot.com/2011/11/time-to-try-jbossws-400cr1.html) and described CR1 version. Have a look at the release notes and [documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/JBWS/JBoss+Web+Services+Documentation) for further details!

  


Finally, I&#39;ve also released the **1.1.0.GA** version of the **JBoss JAX-WS Maven Plugin**, which basically introduces support for the new JBossWS 4 stacks and fixes an important [bug](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBWS-3402) for those leveraging the Maven War Plugin too in their maven project. The artifacts are available as usual on the maven repository.

  


Definitely a lot of stuff to play with during the Christmas vacations ;-) Enjoy!
