Just few hours before the holiday break and here we are with the last releases of the year!  

First of all, **WildFly 10.0.0.CR5** has been released and will soon turn into _Final_ assuming no major flaw is reported. You can read more on the release atÂ [wildfly.org](http://wildfly.org/news/2015/12/23/WildFly10-CR5-Released/)!  

Speaking of web services, yesterday I&#39;ve tagged the second micro release of JBossWS 5.1.x series and today you can download it from [jbossws.jboss.org](http://jbossws.jboss.org/downloads/latest). You might have noticed that we&#39;ve released two bug fix versions this month: **JBossWS 5.1.1.Final** was mainly a 
bug fix
 release (but of course we also moved to the most recent [Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org/) version), while **JBossWS 5.1.2.Final** is basically a 
performance
 improvement release, cut just in time to include it as a last minute change in WildFly 10 :-)  

As usual, have a look at the [release notes](http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-cxf-5.1.2.Final.txt) for a detailed list of changes. The supported target containers for both JBossWS releases are WildFly 9.0.0.Final, 9.0.1.Final and 9.0.2.Final.  

_The year is almost over, time to relax, give the last WildFly 10 CR a try and then get back fully recharged in 2016 to play with WildFly 10 Final :-)_  

**Greetings!**
