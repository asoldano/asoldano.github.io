After some micro bug fix releases on the 5.1 stream, **JBossWS 5.2.0.Final** has eventually been [released](http://jbossws.jboss.org/downloads/latest).  

The latest versions brings a lot of component upgrades to **WildFly**, the most relevant ones being **Apache CXF 3.2** and **JAXB 2.3**. Thanks to many other minor improvements and fixes in the stack, the result is that JBossWS 5.2.0.Final is compatible (and has been tested) with the latest final **JDK 9**.  

Please have a look at the [release notes](http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-cxf-5.2.0.Final.txt) for further details and give it a try!
