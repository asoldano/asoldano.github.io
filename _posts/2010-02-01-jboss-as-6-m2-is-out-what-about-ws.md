Just a brief message to remind [JBoss AS 6 M2](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/AS600M2ReleaseNotes) has just been released. You can read about that from [Brian](http://bstansberry.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/jboss-application-server-6-0-0-m2-is-out/) and [Rich](http://blog.softwhere.org/archives/998), many interesting news come with it.  

If you&#39;re wondering what changes AS 6 M2 includes in terms of web services, basically we pushed multiple JBossWS component upgrades there.  

Among the others, [JBossWS Native 3.2.2](http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-native-3.2.2.GA.txt) improved performances while the 3.3.0.Beta2 currently in AS 6 M2 is a first step in the direction of supporting what&#39;s required for Java EE 6.  

So stay tuned... and 
give JBoss AS 6 M2 a try, it&#39;s worth it
.
