This time we had a fast development cycle... we&#39;ve just released JBossWS 3.1.1.GA. The main reason for this is that we wanted to have this release included in the upcoming JBoss AS 5.1.0.CR1, so we fixed the release date a bit earlier.  

JBossWS 3.1.1.GA is basically a bug fix release,  especially for the CXF and Native stacks. The most important changes are:  

*   Resource injection in jaxws endpoints and handlers
*   Improved CXF integration and upgrade to Apache CXF 2.2
*   wsrunclient script for JBossWS-CXF and JBossWS-Metro
*   Some FastInfoset and MTOM interoperabily fixes and testing
*   Bug fixesPlease refer to the release notes for further details:
