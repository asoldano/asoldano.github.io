It&#39;s not hard to guess, the JBossWS team is currently working on the 
webservices features
 for the future 
JBoss Application Server 7.1.0
.  

With one of the major focuses being on the webservices part of the 
full JavaEE 6 certification requirements
, we&#39;re currently restoring the still missing pieces in the JBossWS - JBoss AS7 integration.  
Yesterday&#39;s betas of both 
Native
 and [
Apache CXF
](http://cxf.apache.org)
 integration
 stacks mark another milestone in the afore mentioned process and bring back 
@WebServiceRef support 
and 
some JAXRPC functionalities
 on AS7.  

Have a look at the release notes [1][2] for the more details and feel free to give the betas a try, feedback is welcome as usual!
