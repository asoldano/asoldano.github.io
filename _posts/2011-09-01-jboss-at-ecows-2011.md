The European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS) is the premier  conference series for both researchers and practitioners to discuss the  latest advances in the state of the art and practices of Web services  and to foster cross-European collaboration and exchange. The 9th edition  of the ECOWS series will be held on September 14-16 at the University  of Lugano, Switzerland.  

JBoss / Red Hat is supporting [ECOWS 2011](http://ecows2011.inf.usi.ch/) as silver sponsor.  
I&#39;ll be attending the conference and [presenting on the JBoss involvement in the webservice area](http://ecows2011.inf.usi.ch/program/industry/jboss).  
The agenda for the event covers multiple tracks, including both research and industry interesting talks.
