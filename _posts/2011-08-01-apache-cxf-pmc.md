Just a quick note to say that I&#39;ve recently been offered to [join the Apache CXF PMC](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/cxf-users/201108.mbox/%3C1458069.ZyjaarYimb@dilbert.dankulp.com%3E) and I accepted.

A project management committee (PMC) is a committee of the Apache Software Foundation charged with responsibility for a top level project. The PMC is the vehicle through which decision making power and responsibility for oversight is devolved to developers.

I&#39;m of course proud of taking part to Apache CXF decisions and will do my best. Thanks to Dan and the other members for the trust.
