After [years of work](http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/ra/), the **_Web Services Resource Access_** specifications have finally been [promoted to W3C recommendations](http://www.w3.org/News/2011#entry-9295)! The new WS-RA standards are:


*   [Web Services Enumeration (WS-Enumeration)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-ws-enumeration-20111213)
*   [Web Services Eventing (WS-Eventing)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-ws-eventing-20111213)
*   [Web Services Transfer (WS-Transfer)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-ws-transfer-20111213)
*   [Web Services Metadata Exchange (WS-MetadataExchange)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-ws-metadata-exchange-20111213)
*   [Web Services Fragment (WS-Fragment)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-ws-fragment-20111213)
*   [Web Services Event Descriptions (WS-EventDescriptions)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-ws-event-descriptions-20111213)
*   [Web Services SOAP Assertions (WS-SOAPAssertions)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-ws-soap-assertions-20111213)
I&#39;d like to congratulate again the working group on this **major achievement** and thank _[Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/)_ (as one of the members participating the group) for having allowed me to take part in the group and join the discussions that led to the standards definition.
